1. Render block which takes a path as its only argument (to show the activity of that folder / project) i.e. (for example `./` for the whole vault activity)

2. In preview mode this block will render the activity similar to Github's contribution board. 
3. To keep it light, by default the plugin will only track the whole vault activity, to track specific project the user must add that path in the settings for example to track project one the following path must be added `./Project_1`
4. Hovering over a box will show a % activity relative to the highest activity in current view
5. Arrows that would change the current year being looked at
